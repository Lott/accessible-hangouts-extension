Accessible Hangouts for Google+
---------------------------------------

Help make hangouts more accessible for those in need!
It extends Hangouts by making it more accessible for the blind.  The first release would focus on the blind, and
we will continue to add more features :)

Since it is really difficult for the blind to access the Hangout chat, this extension would read the chat back to
the user in a clear and accessible way.

Features
--------
 - Says the name once, then the text.
 - Says who parted and joined hangout
 - Doesn't say what you typed.
